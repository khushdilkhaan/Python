    "<hr>\n",
    "Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who created Python?\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person's work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception. <br>\n",
    "There are not many languages whose authors are known by name. Python was created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum\"> Guido van Rossum</a>, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. <br>\n",

    "<p>A language is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts. There are many languages all around us. Some of them require neither speaking nor writing, such as body language; it's possible to express your deepest feelings very precisely without saying a word.</p>\n",
    "\n",

    "    <li>Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more</li>\n",
    "    <li>The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages</li>\n",
    "    <li>The CPU understands a language we call Machine Language</li>\n",

    "    <li>Machine Language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex than Python</li>\n",
    "    <li>We build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU</li>\n",
    "    <li>These programming language translators fall into two general categories: </li>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",

    "    <li>An interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and <strong>interprets the instructions on the fly</strong></li>\n",
    "    <li>A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language </li>\n",
    "    <li>Then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution</li>\n",
